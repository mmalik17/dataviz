This visualization dashboard is created based on the data from Ember climate organization that I found from MakeOver Monday challenge. It shows the trend of renewable energy generation in Europe, country ranking, and portion of energy source generation. The main insight is during 2010-2020, the portion/share of renewable energy generation in Europe is getting higher while the fossil fuel generation is getting lower. 

Beside showing the data over Europe, I also provide the data of trend and portion in every single country in Europe. To access that, just click the dropdown between the word ‘Area’.

## Dashboard 2: Discount overview of Superstore dataset
Discount is one of the strategy to increase sales. However, too much discount would eliminate the profit, or even make a big loss. Hence, for evaluating sales performance, it is needed to identify which discount that would eliminate the profit or make a big loss. 
This dashboard is based on sample superstore dataset, the data bank that provide the sales data of sample superstore in US. In this visualization, I design the dashboard the overview of discount in sample superstore. You can see which segment, product sub-category, or even customer that demand the big discount, and eliminate the profit of the sales.

## Dashboard 3: Startup Overview Around the World: Growth and Distribution
This dashboard is visualizing the startup distribution map, the founding of startup over time, and the startup category by its market. By looking to this dashboard, the reader could have insight about which market category that has the most number of startup or the biggest funding over time. In addition to that, I also add time and region filtering to generate more specific data by moving the slicer or clicking the dropdown menu.
